.. _docassembly:

PDF split, merge, and document assembly
***************************************

This section discusses working with PDF pages: splitting, merging, copying,
deleting. We're treating pages as a unit, rather than working with the content of
individual pages.

Let’s continue with ``fourpages.pdf`` from the :ref:`tutorial`.

.. ipython::

    In [1]: from pikepdf import Pdf

    In [2]: pdf = Pdf.open('../tests/resources/fourpages.pdf')

.. note::

    In some parts of the documentation we skip closing ``Pdf`` objects for brevity.
    In production code, you should open them in a ``with`` block or explicitly
    close them.

.. _splitpdf:

Split a PDF into single page PDFs
---------------------------------

All we need are new PDFs to hold the destination pages.

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [1]: pdf = Pdf.open('../tests/resources/fourpages.pdf')

    In [5]: for n, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):
       ...:     dst = Pdf.new()
       ...:     dst.pages.append(page)
       ...:     dst.save(f'{n:02d}.pdf')

.. note::

    This example will transfer data associated with each page, so
    that every page stands on its own. It will *not* transfer some metadata
    associated with the PDF as a whole, such as the list of bookmarks.

.. _mergepdf:

Merge (concatenate) PDF from several PDFs
-----------------------------------------

In this example, we create an empty ``Pdf`` which will be the container for all
the others.

If you are looking to combine multiple PDF pages into a single page, see
:ref:`overlays`.

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [1]: from glob import glob

    In [1]: pdf = Pdf.new()

    In [1]: for file in glob('*.pdf'):
       ...:     src = Pdf.open(file)
       ...:     pdf.pages.extend(src.pages)

    In [1]: pdf.save('merged.pdf')

This code sample is enough to merge most PDFs, but there are some things it
does not do that a more sophisticated function might do. One could call
:meth:`pikepdf.Pdf.remove_unreferenced_resources` to remove unreferenced objects
from the pages' ``/Resources`` dictionaries. It may also be necessary to chose the
most recent version of all source PDFs. Here is a more sophisticated example:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [1]: from glob import glob

    In [1]: pdf = Pdf.new()

    In [1]: version = pdf.pdf_version

    In [1]: for file in glob('*.pdf'):
       ...:     src = Pdf.open(file)
       ...:     version = max(version, src.pdf_version)
       ...:     pdf.pages.extend(src.pages)

    In [1]: pdf.remove_unreferenced_resources()

    In [1]: pdf.save('merged.pdf', min_version=version)

This improved example would still leave metadata blank. It's up to you
to decide how to combine metadata from multiple PDFs.

Reversing the order of pages
----------------------------

Suppose the file was scanned backwards. We can easily reverse it in
place - maybe it was scanned backwards, a common problem with automatic
document scanners.

.. ipython::

    In [1]: pdf.pages.reverse()

.. ipython::

    In [1]: pdf

Pretty nice, isn’t it? But the pages in this file already were in correct
order, so let’s put them back.

.. ipython::

    In [1]: pdf.pages.reverse()

.. _copyother:

Copying pages from other PDFs
-----------------------------

Now, let’s add some content from another file. Because ``pdf.pages`` behaves
like a list, we can use ``pages.extend()`` on another file's pages.

.. ipython::

    In [1]: pdf = Pdf.open('../tests/resources/fourpages.pdf')

    In [1]: appendix = Pdf.open('../tests/resources/sandwich.pdf')

    In [2]: pdf.pages.extend(appendix.pages)

We can use ``pages.insert()`` to insert into one of more pages into a specific
position, bumping everything else ahead.

Copying pages between ``Pdf`` objects will create a shallow copy of the source
page within the target ``Pdf``, rather than the typical Python behavior of
creating a reference. Therefore modifying ``pdf.pages[-1]`` will not affect
``appendix.pages[0]``. (Normally, assigning objects between Python lists creates
a reference, so that the two objects are identical, ``list[0] is list[1]``.)

.. ipython::

    In [3]: graph = Pdf.open('../tests/resources/graph.pdf')

    In [4]: pdf.pages.insert(1, graph.pages[0])

    In [5]: len(pdf.pages)

We can also replace specific pages with assignment (or slicing).

.. ipython::

    In [1]: congress = Pdf.open('../tests/resources/congress.pdf')

    In [1]: pdf.pages[2].objgen

    In [1]: pdf.pages[2] = congress.pages[0]

    In [1]: pdf.pages[2].objgen

The method above will break any indirect references (such as table of contents
entries and hyperlinks) within ``pdf`` to ``pdf.pages[2]``. Perhaps that is the
behavior you want, if the replacement means those references are no longer
valid. This is shown by the change in :attr:`pikepdf.Object.objgen`.

Emplacing pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perhaps the PDF you are working with has a table of contents or internal hyperlinks,
meaning that there are indirect references to a specific page object. If you
want change the content of a page object while preserving references to it,
use :meth:`pikepdf.Object.emplace`, which will delete all of the content of
the target and replace it with the content of the source, thus preserving
indirect references to the page. (Think of this as demolishing the interior
of a house, but keeping it at the same address.)

.. ipython::

    In [1]: pdf = Pdf.open('../tests/resources/fourpages.pdf')

    In [1]: congress = Pdf.open('../tests/resources/congress.pdf')

    In [1]: pdf.pages[2].objgen

    In [1]: pdf.pages.append(congress.pages[0])  # Transfer page to new pdf

    In [1]: pdf.pages[2].emplace(pdf.pages[-1])

    In [1]: del pdf.pages[-1]  # Remove donor page

    In [1]: pdf.pages[2].objgen

Copying pages within a PDF
--------------------------

As you may have guessed, we can assign pages to copy them within a ``Pdf``:

.. ipython::

    In [1]: pdf = Pdf.open('../tests/resources/fourpages.pdf')

    In [1]: pdf.pages[3] = pdf.pages[0]  # The last shall be made first

As above, copying a page creates a shallow copy rather than a Python object
reference.

Also as above :meth:`pikepdf.Object.emplace` can be used to create a copy that
preserves the functionality of indirect references within the PDF.

Using counting numbers
----------------------

Because PDF pages are usually numbered in counting numbers (1, 2, 3…),
pikepdf provides a convenience accessor ``.p()`` that uses counting
numbers:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [1]: pdf.pages.p(1)        # The first page in the document

    In [1]: pdf.pages[0]          # Also the first page in the document

    In [1]: pdf.pages.remove(p=1)   # Remove first page in the document

To avoid confusion, the ``.p()`` accessor does not accept Python slices,
and ``.p(0)`` raises an exception. It is also not possible to delete using it.

PDFs may define their own numbering scheme or different numberings for
different sections, such as using Roman numerals for an introductory section.
``.pages`` does not look up this information.

Accessing page labels
---------------------

If a PDF defines custom page labels, such as a typical report with preface material
beginning with Roman numerals (i, ii, iii...), body using Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3...),
and an appendix using some other convention (A-1, A-2, ...), you can look up the
page label as follows:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [1]: pdf.pages[1].label
    Out[1]: 'i'

There is currently no API to help with modifying the ``pdf.Root.PageLabels`` data
structure, which contains the label definitions.

Pages information from Root
---------------------------

.. warning::

    It's possible to obtain page information through :attr:`pikepdf.Pdf.Root`
    object but **not recommended**. (In PDF parlance, this is the ``/Root``
    object).

    The internal consistency of the various ``/Page`` and ``/Pages`` is not
    guaranteed when accessed in this manner, and in some PDFs the data structure
    for these is fairly complex. Use the ``.pages`` interface instead.
